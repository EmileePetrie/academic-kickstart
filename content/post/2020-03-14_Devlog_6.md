summary: Rather than focusing on filling out a few columns, I started going through the data row by row to make sure everything was there.

# Review of All Columns

As we've had different people inputting different things and sometimes the same things, it got a little confusing where we were at. I, therefore, took a row-by-row approach to review everything that had been inputted to date and input anything that was missing. The missing informaiton was consistently the NumberOfComponents, Group1, Category1 and Subcategory 1 as this data is not explicitly stated in the material records but can be extrapolated from artifacts with all the information already digitized. For most artifaccts, there was a single component which could be categorized as Group1 **Exploration and Survey**, Category1 **Landmarks** and Subcategory1 **Markers**. I also added or edited other data. I left stopped after the 19th artifact, so *I will have to return to artifact no. 20*.
