# More Questions

It is getting a little confusing about what is copmlete. Did a quick scan to add somethings and seems like I will have to go backk to the start and review everything to make sure everything is filled out.

For Replacer column, make note if the marker was not replaced as there then should not be a replacer.

Do we have a colum for who originally put the marker there? Did not check.

Regarding Jessica's presentation on metadata and paradata, identify a standard and rationalize. Jessica has committed to looking at standards. Will meet on Saturday to review work and standards.
