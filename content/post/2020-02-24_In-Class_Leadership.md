# Interpretation

### Introduction
Both articles by Anderson et al. and Canning discuss interpreting and creating interpretations of history in non-traditional, non-Rankean ways. 

Leopold von Ranke is a German historian and the founder of the modern documentary approach to history. He privileged the role of archives in the study of history and created a sort of scientific approach to history requiring textual sources as evidence. This established a sense of objectivity in the field of history. 

Anderson et al. emphasize writing history “from below”. Questioning the absences in archives and the privileging of texts over oral history and undocumented lived experiences. Canning, on the other hand, opposes the Rankean idea of objectivity in the study of history by stressing the importance of the affective experience of museums. Many museums have taken new and different approaches to history, but Rankean traditions are persistent in the field and we must continue to navigate Ranke’s legacy. 

### Anderson et al.'s "Interpretation: Liberating the Narrative"
In “Interpretation: Liberating the Narrative”, Anderson et al. explore how we can liberate historical narratives from traditional and colonial systems of interpretation by increasing exhibitions that represent minorities groups. 

They define interpretation as “a narrative and a method of communicating to and with visitors” (Anderson et al., 89). They also describe it as a language, a bridge, a system of communicating, and a cultural experience (Anderson et al., 89-90). Interpretation is communicated visually, verbally and textually through tours, labels, videos and other methods. Interpretation conveys a narrative or message about a particular subject and has the potential to shape how people understand it.

Anderson et al. also discuss museums as Eurocentric institutions that act as keepers and conveyers of knowledge (90). Because they are derived from colonial systems and values, museums often present a narrative that espouses colonial values and privileges white perspectives. The study of history in Europe and North America has been shaped by Rankean ideas of documentation, which privileges European styles of documentation and, therefore, Eurocentric narratives. Therefore, groups who do not document their history in the same textual manner as Europeans find themselves absent in records and minimally represented in museums. 

Question: **How can we interpret history in non-Eurocentric terms?**

However, there has been movement to more diverse interpretations in the last few decades and to question these historical silences or absences. This movement is supported by Anderson et al. who argue that “Museum interpretation can and should move in the direction of being dialogic (conversational), de-centered (all people given equal consideration), and open source (sharing authority with audiences, particularly those directly affected by the legacies of our spaces)” (90). 

They argue that we need to reconceptualize how we approach museums and interpretation in order to better represent the experiences of marginalized peoples. They identify several different strategies to transform the GLAM sector. These strategies include: expanding research; learning critical race theory; identifying gaps; exploring intersectionality; creating polyvocality; listening to and making space for the public recontextualizing information and perspectives; asserting a position; conducting cultural responsive evaluations; and engaging the human experience (Anderson et al., 97-99). They also speak to several ways to make these changes, including the incorporation of expert advisors in the planning process, focus groups, community conversations, and co-creating exhibitions. 

### Example: The Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR)
As an example of the interpretation discussed in Anderson et al.’s and Canning’s articles, I want to point us toward the Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR)

In 2016, the CMHR opened The Witness Blanket exhibition, which incorporated Anderson et al.’s suggestion of using expert advisor and co-creation. Carey Newman, a First Nations artist and carver created the national moment to Residential School survivors and victims using objects that acted as witnesses to the experiences of these children. 

The museum has not always been so inclusive of Indigenous voices. For a long time, there was outcry against how the CMHR refused to classify the experiences of Indigenous peoples in Canada as a genocide and, instead, qualified it as a cultural genocide. The CMHR presented a colonial narrative of the experiences of Indigenous peoples in North America through this qualification. The use of “cultural genocide” is significant because cultural genocide was excluded from the UN Genocide Convention due to pressure from colonial powers, despite its inclusion in earlier drafts. The colonial powers did not want to implicate themselves, so they refused to include the destruction of culture in the definition of genocide. The use of the term is also significant because indigenous perspectives were excluded from participation in the creation of the UN Genocide Convention and because its qualification ignores or is ignorant of the importance of culture to the social, economic and political make up of Indigenous communities.

However, in May 2019, the CMHR changed its position and acknowledged that colonialism constitutes genocide. This is after the outcry of Indigenous peoples and after the MMIWG began discussion around colonial genocide but before the release of the MMIWG Final Report. Louise Waldman, the museum’s manager of marketing and communications, stated that “we recognize as a museum that our lack of clear acknowledgment of the genocide against Indigenous Peoples has caused hurt, and we’ve listened and we are working to do better.” 

The CMHR’s stance on genocide and cultural genocide demonstrates an attempt to stay neutral. However, as Anderson et al. argue, museums need to assert a position. They write that “Museum professionals avoid difficult or controversial topics but do not realize that their silence and avoidance is a very clear stance,” which, in this case, supports a colonial narrative (99). The museum’s new narrative listens to and respects the genocidal experiences of Indigenous peoples. 

The CMHR’s use of “cultural genocide” also failed to recognize the affective experience this term would have on Indigenous peoples. 

The CMHR’s The Blanket Witness exhibition is also very affective, witnessing the trauma of a generation of children and the intergenerational trauma experienced in their communities and by their families. However, although The Witness Blanket is clearly intended to be an affective exhibition, it maintains a sense of objective language, not acknowledging the affective and emotional impact it will have on visitors. This leads us into the next article. 

### Erin Canning's "Affect in Information Systems: A Knowledge Organization System Approach to Documenting Visitor-Artwork Experiences"
In “Affect in Information Systems: A Knowledge Organization System Approach to Documenting Visitor-Artwork Experiences,” Erin Canning looks at affect as a way we can better understand objects and how they are interpreted or experienced by visitors. She draws on Cifor’s discussion of affect in defining the term. She defines it “as a ‘culturally, socially, and historically constructed category that both encompasses and reaches beyond feelings and emotions.’” 

Question: **How do you identify affect for the purpose of evaluating it as data?**

According to scholars of aesthetic, “aesthetic (affective) qualities exist in potential within an artwork, and that an aesthetic experience is the actualization of those qualities.” In the context of a museum, an object is not solely an object but something that is experienced. And that experience needs to be accounted for. 

Canning’s article looks at a conceptual framework for including affect in how we understand museums and, therefore, in museum information systems and standards. She suggests that “[v]isitors’ experiences in museums can only be explained if affective components are considered” as affect is a critical component in the process of forming meaning. Therefore, a model to structure affective metadata to correspond with existing metadata and standard terms of affect are required.

Canning proposes an event-centric information model as the model through which we can incorporate affective metadata. 

Question: **What is the difference between an event-centric and an object-centric information model?**

“[E]vent-centric models centre an event which then links data points to an object.” This is as opposed to object-centric models in which data is centered around the object. The event-centric model allows for the incorporation of a greater context of the object, acknowledging the affect of that event that is conveyed through the object to the viewer. 

She proposes to develop affective data through the event-centric cultural information data model CIDOC-CRM as it conceptualizes data as outcomes of events (e.g. affective data as a result of the meeting between a person, their experiences, and an object). Looking at a generic event-centric model, Canning identifies several data points relevant to identifying and categorizing affective data, including the object, the actor, the context, the session, the response, and the actualization. By understanding this data and the relationship between these data points, we can attempt to understand affect in museums.

Another core element of collecting and reflecting affect is a standard of affective language or, as Canning calls it, “a taxonomy of affective language (a content standard).” An affect thesaurus has been developed as a model to standardize, categorize and measure affective experiences. The thesaurus looks at 8 major categories, subdivided in 30 total categories with four ranks in each to evaluate the intensity of the affect. It is modeled on an authority record which is a standardized form of reference. 

The thesaurus standardizes affective metadata, the evaluation of affective experiences is still required. Canning identifies several ways to evaluate affect, including interviews, physiological feedback (e.g. FitBit) and behavioural observation. Interviews are one of the most useful and informative ways to collect affective data. However, it is not without its issues; namely time to conduct and review the interviews. Better techniques and tools are there for required to make collecting and utilizing affective data practical for the GLAM sector. 

A lot of work needs to be done to cover all components of affective data, but there are routes and models available to start this work. As Canning writes, “Affective attributes make up a part of what an artwork is and does, and can only be seen through the viewers’ experiences with the artwork.”


*So I will leave you with this question: how might ideas of representational and affective interpretation influence or correspond with the projects we are working on in this class?*
