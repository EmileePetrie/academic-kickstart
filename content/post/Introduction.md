# HIST4806A: Museums + Digital History 

*This repository has been constructed as part of the course HIST4806A: Museums + Digital History, which is taught by Professor Shawn Graham.*

[HIST4806A](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/) is a fourth year history course at Carleton University. In this course, we will work with several museums in the National Capital Region to digitize their collections and learn more about the function of preservation and access in a digital-based society. We will conclude by hosting a Heritage Jam in which we present what we have learned throughout the semester.

> How do museums and other organizations in the "GLAM" sector (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why migth it matter? Where are the dangers - and the whom could it be dangerous? 

In this repository, I will track the work I have done and what I have learned throughout the course.
