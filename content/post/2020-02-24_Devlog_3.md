title: Devlog 3 - Group Meeting
Summary: Group meeting on next steps and cleaning up data

---

My group met today after class. Maggie has isolated the survey markers from the CSTM open data portal linked on the [course website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/datasette-with-glitch/). She uploaded the data sheet continaing the survey markers to our shared drive. We then divided up work to clean up the data and confirm it aligns with the paper records we have. I committed to confirming and inputting the dates into the data set, and to creating a process document to track our decisions and changes. 

We decided that we will not be deleting or replacing any of the information already in the data set. Instead, we will add new columns distinguished by a light red colour in which we will input new data. The end result will be three data sets: an original, a master (with the old and new data), and a clean (only new and relevant old data) documents. This way, we will not lose any information and should things go wrong somewhere and somehow, we will still have the original informaiton.
